# Sofeia AI Agent Project

## Overview
Sofeia AI Agent is an intelligent multi-provider content creation platform with an advanced, dynamic credit management system that encourages user engagement through innovative renewal mechanisms.

## Recent Changes (January 27, 2025)

### Anti-Sleep Deployment Fixes (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented keep-alive mechanisms to prevent server sleep
✅ **SOLVED:** "Not Found" errors when accessing deployed site (contentscale.site/admin)
✅ **ADDED:** Self-ping system - server pings itself every 14 minutes in production
✅ **ENHANCED:** Health check endpoints with database monitoring and error detection
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Production process management with graceful shutdown
✅ **OPTIMIZED:** Memory management and connection pooling
✅ **MONITORING:** Comprehensive health reporting with uptime and memory usage

### Previous Deployment Fixes Applied (January 27, 2025)
✓ Added health check endpoints at `/health` and `/healthcheck` for deployment health checks  
✓ Added `/api/health` endpoint for comprehensive health monitoring  
✓ **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed health check from root path (`/`) to allow main application interface to load properly  
✓ **DEPLOYMENT READY:** Root path now serves full Sofeia AI application interface instead of JSON health response
✓ Fixed duplicate method definitions in `server/storage.ts`  
✓ Resolved upload method naming conflicts (`createUpload` → `createUploadFile`)  
✓ Updated storage interface with consistent typing  
✓ Removed broken `UploadedFile` type references  
✓ Updated IStorage interface to include all implemented methods (security, user management, file uploads, admin messages)
✓ Ensured proper TypeScript consistency between interface and implementation

### Storage Class Corrections
✓ Eliminated duplicate `uploads` property declarations  
✓ Renamed file upload methods to avoid conflicts:
  - `createUpload` → `createUploadFile`
  - `getUserUploads` → `getUserUploadFiles`  
  - `getUpload` → `getUploadFile`
  - `deleteUpload` → `deleteUploadFile`
✓ Added missing user management methods for authentication
✓ Fixed interface mismatch by adding all missing method signatures to IStorage

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript React frontend
- Node.js Express backend
- Sophisticated credit renewal model with tiered bonus credits
- Multi-AI provider integration (Groq, Perplexity, Claude, Anthropic)
- Real-time user credit tracking
- Automated bonus credit system with complex 14-day expiration cycle
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM

## Architecture Notes
- Health check endpoints support deployment requirements
- Development mode uses Vite middleware (may intercept some routes)
- Production mode serves static files and API routes properly
- Session management with PostgreSQL store
- Multi-provider AI routing system

## Next Steps
- Deploy application with corrected health check endpoints
- Monitor deployment health via `/api/health` endpoint
- Verify all file upload functionality works with corrected method names
