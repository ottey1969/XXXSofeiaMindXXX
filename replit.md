# Sofeia AI Agent Project

## Overview
Sofeia AI Agent is an intelligent multi-provider content creation platform with an advanced, dynamic credit management system that encourages user engagement through innovative renewal mechanisms.

## Recent Changes (January 27, 2025)

### Enhanced Multilingual Keyword Understanding (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Enhanced keyword extraction and context understanding for all languages (Nederlands, Deutsch, Français, Español, Italiano, English)
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Advanced multilingual keyword detection that identifies focus keywords from quoted terms and industry-specific language patterns
✅ **ENHANCED:** AI now correctly identifies main topics (e.g., "dakwerken") instead of confusing them with request format (e.g., "content plan")
✅ **ADDED:** Language-specific preposition patterns (voor/für/pour/para/per/for) to extract actual keywords from requests
✅ **IMPROVED:** Focus keyword detection ensures AI builds responses around actual topics, not request structure
✅ **FIXED:** AI now understands the difference between what users want content ABOUT vs. what type of content they want

### Comprehensive Request Understanding Enhancement (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Enhanced AI to follow and understand ALL user requests comprehensively
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Advanced request analysis system that detects multiple requirements, constraints, and request types
✅ **ENHANCED:** All AI services now receive comprehensive instruction analysis for complete request fulfillment
✅ **ADDED:** Multi-request detection in multiple languages (English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Italian)
✅ **IMPROVED:** Step-by-step guidance detection and constraint recognition across all AI providers
✅ **FIXED:** AI now systematically addresses every part of user requests without missing requirements

### Multilingual Conversation Context Enhancement (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Enhanced conversation history tracking - AI now maintains context throughout conversations
✅ **IMPROVED:** Language detection with conversation memory - maintains user's language across all messages
✅ **ENHANCED:** All AI services (Groq, Perplexity, Anthropic) now receive and use conversation history
✅ **ADDED:** Context-aware language detection from conversation history
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Multilingual conversation continuity with proper follow-ups and references
✅ **FIXED:** AI now remembers what conversations are about and builds upon previous messages

### Anti-Sleep Deployment Fixes (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented keep-alive mechanisms to prevent server sleep
✅ **SOLVED:** "Not Found" errors when accessing deployed site (contentscale.site/admin)
✅ **ADDED:** Self-ping system - server pings itself every 14 minutes in production
✅ **ENHANCED:** Health check endpoints with database monitoring and error detection
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Production process management with graceful shutdown
✅ **OPTIMIZED:** Memory management and connection pooling
✅ **MONITORING:** Comprehensive health reporting with uptime and memory usage

### Previous Deployment Fixes Applied (January 27, 2025)
✓ Added health check endpoints at `/health` and `/healthcheck` for deployment health checks  
✓ Added `/api/health` endpoint for comprehensive health monitoring  
✓ **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed health check from root path (`/`) to allow main application interface to load properly  
✓ **DEPLOYMENT READY:** Root path now serves full Sofeia AI application interface instead of JSON health response
✓ Fixed duplicate method definitions in `server/storage.ts`  
✓ Resolved upload method naming conflicts (`createUpload` → `createUploadFile`)  
✓ Updated storage interface with consistent typing  
✓ Removed broken `UploadedFile` type references  
✓ Updated IStorage interface to include all implemented methods (security, user management, file uploads, admin messages)
✓ Ensured proper TypeScript consistency between interface and implementation

### Storage Class Corrections
✓ Eliminated duplicate `uploads` property declarations  
✓ Renamed file upload methods to avoid conflicts:
  - `createUpload` → `createUploadFile`
  - `getUserUploads` → `getUserUploadFiles`  
  - `getUpload` → `getUploadFile`
  - `deleteUpload` → `deleteUploadFile`
✓ Added missing user management methods for authentication
✓ Fixed interface mismatch by adding all missing method signatures to IStorage

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript React frontend
- Node.js Express backend
- Sophisticated credit renewal model with tiered bonus credits
- Multi-AI provider integration (Groq, Perplexity, Claude, Anthropic)
- Real-time user credit tracking
- Automated bonus credit system with complex 14-day expiration cycle
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM

## Architecture Notes
- Health check endpoints support deployment requirements
- Development mode uses Vite middleware (may intercept some routes)
- Production mode serves static files and API routes properly
- Session management with PostgreSQL store
- Multi-provider AI routing system

## Next Steps
- Deploy application with corrected health check endpoints
- Monitor deployment health via `/api/health` endpoint
- Verify all file upload functionality works with corrected method names
