## Overview
Sofeia AI Agent is an intelligent multi-provider content creation platform with an advanced, dynamic credit management system that encourages user engagement through innovative renewal mechanisms.

## Recent Changes (January 27, 2025)

✅ **BREAKTHROUGH:** Implemented universal topic research for ANY subject
✅ **DYNAMIC:** Statistics adapt to user's specific topic, not predefined categories
✅ **RESEARCH ENGINE:** Multi-source authentication (government, academic, industry)
✅ **REAL-TIME:** Finds authentic statistics for any topic through live research
✅ **VALIDATION:** Authority-based ranking system (.gov, .edu, verified sources)
✅ **COMPREHENSIVE:** Government APIs + industry reports + academic data
✅ **NO LIMITS:** Works for any topic user requests (roofing, blockchain, veterinary, etc.)

### Real-Time Data Integration (January 27, 2025 - 2:50 AM)
✅ **ELIMINATED:** All dummy/fallback data - now ONLY real-time research
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Authentic government API integration (Census Bureau, BLS, EPA, SBA)
✅ **ADDED:** Real statistics tables with verified data sources
✅ **ENHANCED:** External links to high-authority .gov/.edu sources only
✅ **DATA SOURCES:**
  - Census Bureau: Business Dynamics Statistics API
  - Bureau of Labor Statistics: Employment data API
  - SBA: Small business statistics (2024 Capital Impact Report)
  - EPA/DOE: Energy efficiency and roofing industry data
  - No dummy data fallbacks - authentic research only

### 4000-Word Content Support & Groq Professional Formatting (January 27, 2025 - 3:51 AM)
✅ **ENHANCED:** All three AI services now support 4000-word comprehensive content
✅ **FIXED:** Groq plain text formatting - NO markdown or HTML syntax
✅ **UPDATED:** Token limits increased to 4096 across all services (Anthropic, Perplexity, Groq)
✅ **CLARIFIED:** Groq should ask clarifying questions when requests are unclear
✅ **GROQ PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS:**
  - Pure plain text output with professional, executive-level communication
  - Can use actual bold text (not **markdown**), no HTML/markdown syntax
  - Maintains business and academic writing standards
  - Asks clarifying questions professionally when input is unclear
  - Provides comprehensive templates and strategic guidance
✅ **ROUTING LOGIC:**
  - **Anthropic**: Blog posts, articles, content creation, copywriting
  - **Perplexity**: Research queries, market analysis, trending topics  
  - **Groq**: Professional plain text content, quick responses, clarifying questions

### Anti-Sleep Deployment Fixes (January 27, 2025)
✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented keep-alive mechanisms to prevent server sleep
✅ **SOLVED:** "Not Found" errors when accessing deployed site (contentscale.site/admin)
✅ **ADDED:** Self-ping system - server pings itself every 14 minutes in production
✅ **ENHANCED:** Health check endpoints with database monitoring and error detection
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Production process management with graceful shutdown
✅ **OPTIMIZED:** Memory management and connection pooling
✅ **MONITORING:** Comprehensive health reporting with uptime and memory usage

### Previous Deployment Fixes Applied (January 27, 2025)
✓ Added health check endpoints at `/health` and `/healthcheck` for deployment health checks  
✓ Added `/api/health` endpoint for comprehensive health monitoring  
✓ **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed health check from root path (`/`) to allow main application interface to load properly  
✓ **DEPLOYMENT READY:** Root path now serves full Sofeia AI application interface instead of JSON health response
✓ Fixed duplicate method definitions in `server/storage.ts`  
✓ Resolved upload method naming conflicts (`createUpload` → `createUploadFile`)  
✓ Updated storage interface with consistent typing  
✓ Removed broken `UploadedFile` type references  
✓ Updated IStorage interface to include all implemented methods (security, user management, file uploads, admin messages)
✓ Ensured proper TypeScript consistency between interface and implementation

### Storage Class Corrections
✓ Eliminated duplicate `uploads` property declarations  
✓ Renamed file upload methods to avoid conflicts:
  - `createUpload` → `createUploadFile`
  - `getUserUploads` → `getUserUploadFiles`  
  - `getUpload` → `getUploadFile`
  - `deleteUpload` → `deleteUploadFile`
✓ Added missing user management methods for authentication
✓ Fixed interface mismatch by adding all missing method signatures to IStorage

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript React frontend
- Node.js Express backend
- Sophisticated credit renewal model with tiered bonus credits
- Multi-AI provider integration (Groq, Perplexity, Claude, Anthropic)
- Real-time user credit tracking
- Automated bonus credit system with complex 14-day expiration cycle
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM

## Architecture Notes
- Health check endpoints support deployment requirements
- Development mode uses Vite middleware (may intercept some routes)
- Production mode serves static files and API routes properly
- Session management with PostgreSQL store
- Multi-provider AI routing system

## Next Steps
- Deploy application with corrected health check endpoints
- Monitor deployment health via `/api/health` endpoint
- Verify all file upload functionality works with corrected method names
